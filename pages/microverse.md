## What is it?

Practi.City Microverse is a browser-based 3D world featuring a full city layout—complete with streets, buildings, a nuclear plant, a port, and an airport.

Sound familiar? If you’re looking to manage citizen happiness or defend your town from Godzilla like in SIMCITY™, you’re in the wrong place! Practi.City isn't a game; it’s a platform designed to showcase experiential learning and open-source solutions by envisioning a city dedicated entirely to educational simulations.

## Why?

The internet is full of experiential learning resources. We curate and categorize these materials, using a familiar 3D interface to offer an intuitive, original way to explore the various domains Practi.City covers.

Ultimately, our goal is to pioneer "cross-simulations"—combining different learning environments to foster collaboration and shared assets. For instance, pairing a Model UN assembly with an interpreter school creates a unique, high-value experience for participants in both fields.

As the saying goes: "If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together." Perhaps one day, this city will become a reality. Who knows?


## How to access it ?
You will need a usual laptop or your phone to navigate into PractiCity Microverse, nothing else, no installation (thanks to babylon.js - see our public repository at github).

Navigate by pressing SPACE BAR and move the mouse to orientate the direction like you would do in a 'first person view' game. Interact with buildings, items or people by clicking on the items when there is a possible interaction.
